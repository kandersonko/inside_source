## Javascript apps
The following is used to integrate the javascript applications:
1. Create a folder in assets/lib folder and include the Javascript bundle of the application
2. Create a custom layout that extends the default layout, in the _layout folder.
3. Include the Javascript bundle in the custom layout from step 2 in a script tag.
4. Create a new markdown page, in the content folder, which uses the custom layout created in step 2.
